<h2>Features</h2>

The app includes the following features:

User Authentication: Secure signup, login, and logout functionality using JWT tokens. Users can create accounts and access their notes across devices.

Add Notes: Users can add notes with a title, content, and category (Business, Personal, Important). Notes are visually tagged with color indicators based on their category.

Filter Notes: Users can filter notes by category using a dropdown menu. Selecting ‚ÄúAll Notes‚Äù returns to the homepage displaying all notes without requiring a page refresh.

Search Functionality: A search bar allows users to find notes by title or content keywords dynamically.

Responsive Design: Notes are displayed in a three-column layout on larger screens, while on smaller screens, they stack vertically and remain centered. The layout adjusts dynamically based on device width.

Dynamic Feedback: Toast notifications provide immediate feedback for actions like login, signup, logout, note creation, or errors.

Mobile-Friendly Interface: Forms, cards, buttons, and filters scale properly to smaller devices, maintaining usability and readability.
